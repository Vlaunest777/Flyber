# Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the Fabi bird, which constantly moves to the right. 

# The player is tasked with guiding Fabi through pairs of pipes with gaps of the same size, 
located at an arbitrary height. 

# Fabi automatically descends and rises only when the player taps on the touch screen. 

# Each successful passage of a pair of pipes awards the player one point.

# A collision with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. 

# During the game over screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if he scored ten or more points, 
a silver medal for twenty points, a gold medal for thirty points and a platinum medal for forty points.
